oekofen-stats
=============

Simple scripts to fetch statistics from a ÖkoFEN Pellematic Smart
solar pellet heating connected to our LAN.

We want to process the log generated by the ÖkoFEN heating controller
and produce nice graphs.

Requirements
------------

This requires perl as well as `rrdtool`.

Components
----------

* The `fetch-log.pl` fetches one log file at a time and calls
  `process-log.pl` with the retrieved file name.

* `process-log.pl` iterates through the log file and stores the
  interesting values in RRD files and creates some graphs.

Install
-------

To install, copy the whole lot to `/usr/local/oekofen-stats/` and

* Copy `oekofen.cfg.dist` to `oekofen.cfg`

* Edit `oekofen.cfg` to change the correct URL of your Pellematic
  smart

* Configure your webserver to serve `/usr/local/oekofen-stats/web/`

* If you are happy with the result, install the cron job in order to
  fetch new values every 5 minutes:
  `ln -s /usr/local/oekofen-stats/cron/local-oekofen-stats /etc/cron.d/`
